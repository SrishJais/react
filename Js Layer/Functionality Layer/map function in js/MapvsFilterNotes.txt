1)Map-
    i) Traverse each arr elm ,do calculation using arr elm(if req) ,return completely new thing(like <>hgghk</>) /modified thing(val*2) 
    ii) map can be used with condition(if-else/conditional rendering) or without condition
    iii)map with conditio-
      if some elm not req to render based on condition then it must return null as an elm of new created array but size of new created array 
      remains same as the arr whose elm is rendering but size does not get reduced unlike filter function

USE- render each arr elm with/without condition + return completely new thing/modified thing/return null(when some elm not req to render)

2)Filter-
    i)skip/keep the already existing arr elm in new created arr as it is, based on condition
    ii)It does not return new thing or modified thing unlike map function but return only already existed elm of arr
    iii)It may reduce size of arr

USE- only keep req already existing arr elm without any modification or without returning/ storing new elm other than elm of already existed arr
